# Zoe's ASCII art library
This is just a little library of ASCII art that I made, enjoy. The "rawtext" directory is all just plaintext ASCII art but the "colorized" directory ones all have color escapes.





And yes, I know that some of these use Unicode characters and are thus not technically "ASCII art", I'll fix the terminology when people start casually using the term "Unicode Art" widespread.
